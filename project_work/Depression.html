      <div id="i4">
        <h3>Breathing</h3>
        <p>
          Understanding the profound connection between our breath and mental state is essential. The rhythm of our breath reflects our thoughts and emotions. Through mindful breathing, we can effectively navigate through challenges such as depression or negativity. Take a moment to simply observe your breath without altering its natural flow. Over time, you'll notice a gentle, calming effect as your breath naturally deepens and slows. During this practice, if negative thoughts or emotions arise, acknowledge them without reacting. By cultivating this awareness, you'll experience a sense of lightness and relaxation.

        <h3>Fitness</h3>
        <p>
          When was the last time you took a walk, hit the gym, or played an outdoor game? Physical fitness is essential for mental well-being. Neglecting it is like neglecting your personal growth. It's time to start. Begin with a simple walk or jog in a nearby garden. Make new workout buddies to keep you motivated. Dive into outdoor sports for added fun and fitness.

          By incorporating regular physical activity into one's routine, individuals can experience significant improvements in their mood, overall mental well-being, and even a reduction in symptoms of depression. Because our body is not designed for staying idle.

        <h3>Positivity</h3>
         <p>
          Someone really said  the truth, 'What we think, we become.' If we constantly dwell on negativity, we'll find ourselves trapped in a cycle of despair. Negative thinking has disastrous effects, often being a root cause of depression. But how do we break free from this cycle? The answer is simple: flood our minds with intense positivity. When negative thoughts arise, replace them with positive counterparts. Ignore negativity as we would negative personalities. Believe in your worth and potential. Your mind holds immense power. Keep it filled with positivity. Crucially, refrain from harboring ill will towards others. Let go of jealousy and hatred, and instead, nurture love in your heart for everyone. Be selfless and offer support to friends and family.
          Love is the most powerful thing in Universe.

        <h3>Sunlight</h3>
        <p>
          Sunlight boosts our mood by helping our brain release serotonin, a chemical that makes us feel happy. When we're exposed to sunlight, our brain produces more serotonin, lifting our spirits and making us feel better overall.spending time outdoors in natural sunlight, even for short periods, can have a positive impact on mood, energy levels, and overall mental well-being.
          Not getting enough sunlight can lower your serotonin levels, which might cause major depression.
         Studies shown that people with depression have low vitamin D levels.
          Sun exposure is the most natural way to get enough vitamin D. Therefore Morning sunlight is the best source of vitamin D.

        <h3>Habits</h3>
        <p>
          Habits shape our daily actions and behaviors, crucial for success. Positive habits like setting goals and staying organized enhance productivity and motivation. Conversely, bad habits like fast-food , ciggarattes, mature content etc hinder progress, leading to frustration and stress. These negative patterns can erode self-confidence and contribute to depression. The brain's reward system, especially dopamine, reinforces habits. Breaking bad habits involves rewiring neural pathways through conscious effort and positive reinforcement. Identifying triggers, modifying routines, and fostering supportive environments aid in this process. Understanding habit science empowers individuals to cultivate positive behaviors, unlocking success and emotional well-being. Meditation helps in breaking a bad habit.
